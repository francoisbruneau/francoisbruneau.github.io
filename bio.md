François Bruneau is an autodidact, passionate videographer who strongly believes that great work can be done with modest tools.

Irreparably bewitched by cinema and music in his childhood, François first took up a camcorder in his teenage years to document a late-night party held in secret in his father’s eyeglasses shop, stealing the style, tone (and even titles) from first-person French TV show « Paris Dernière ».

In the winter of 2002, he helped his best friend Ben complete a visual essay on the relationship between man and city. Both grabbed a DVcam and roamed around Saint-Brieuc, Brittany in a car at night to capture dreamy, hi-iso noise material which enabled to complete the vision. They went back to François’ room, where editing was performed without any kind of dedicated hardware – just two manually-synchronized VCRs and a couple of analog cables running from his PC to hook up the soundtrack. The result earned the top grade at his friend’s high scool.

Two years later, François was tapped as co-director of Ben’s next video essay, a continuation in exploring how humans interact with the urban setting. He took cameraman duty, as well as editor – this time using a fully-digital workflow, granting the pair as much freedom and precision as they wanted with cutting and effects. Again, the short experimental film garnered praise at Ben’s architecture school.

In 2005, the social network Flickr catalyzed an intense passion for still photography. Over a couple of years, François captured places, moods and people – gradually improving his gear from a rudimentary compact camera, to bridge camera, and finally a DSLR.

In 2007, another permanent brain damage occured as François was exposed alone in his Parisian room to the cult short film « La Jetée » from Chris Marker. Time and women would never be the same again. It did not take long for him to start dreaming about a story told in black and white still images, and a couple of years later he was in Brest, France, shooting « La Visiteuse ». This time he focused on writing, directing and editing – leaving the photography to his friend Valérie Baeriswyl.

2012 marked the return of moving pictures as François’ main creative interest, as he acquired a second-hand Canon 5D Mark II DSLR and started shooting private concerts, contemporary dance classes, DIY workshops and social events. His editing skills enabled him to turn the rushes into short, tight videos which vividly captured what it was like to witness these moments.

His most ambitious effort yet came from a shared vision with his long-time friend Kevin Bidault – turned breakdancer and graffiti artist. For four days on location in rainy Brittany, Kevin would perform, and François would capture – this time with a proper stabilizing camera rig. The massive amount of footage remained dormant for two years, until François set residence in a small Cornwall village in the summer of 2016 – where he patiently extracted the stark, tense shots that would constitute « Busta & Havka » – a performance video dedicated to Kevin’s dearest beings. Strong positive feedback on the film encouraged him to keep building upon his sharp eye for framing and instinctive sense of rythm, while increasingly opening up about his work.

Currently, François is diving into his notes with the firm intention of going back to storytelling. He says his next film will open with a woman smoking a cigarette on a balcony at dawn.
